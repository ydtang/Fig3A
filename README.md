This is the readme for the author's model which replicates Figure 3A in the paper: Aberrant neural activity in the peritumoral cortex underlies the progression of tumor associated seizures. 
Model usage:
This code was written in and requires NEURON (tested in version 8.4) which is freely available from http://www.neuron.yale.edu This model was run under the unix/linux and windows 10 operating system.

Proceed as follows:
- Download and expand this archive and compile the mod files located in the "_mod" folder with nrnivmodl ("nrnivmodl _mod" or "nrnivmodl ../_mod" )). Run the demo for unix/linux: x84/64/special mosinit.hoc
or for windows double click mosinit.hoc

If you need more help running NEURON on your platform please consult:https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide
